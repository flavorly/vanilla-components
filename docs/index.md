# 🌙 Moon

Moon is an open source component library with the goal of helping you create beautiful web applications without complex packages and big bundle sizes. We offer you light customizable components that we know most web developers need. The goal of this library is not to be an extensive component package but rather a solution that will take care of most of the components you need, leaving you the responsability to develop others more specific to your context.

Feel free to also use Moon as a way to kickstart your own component library. We focused on a performant and simple configuration approach.
